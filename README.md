# IBM_Capstone
This repository is a repository of my final output on the IBM Data Science Profesional Certificate. 

The project was done to enable people staying in either Johannesburg and Pretoria (South Africa) but working in the other, to make informed choices on possible similar neighbourhoods in the other city. The final output is a detailed report with a cluster model that maps similar neighbourhoods geospatialy.

Please contact me for any further information.
